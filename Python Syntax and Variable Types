1. Change Codecademy to your name in the script to the right. Run the code to see what it does!
//
my_name = "Lurdė"
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!");

2. Documentation is an important step in programming. Write a comment describing the first program you want to write!
//
# Lurde_A. First Python Program

3. Print the distinguished greeting “Hello world!”
//
print("Hello world!")

4. Print your name using the print() command.//
//
print("Lurde")           OR            print('Lurde')

5. Update the variable meal to reflect each meal of the day before we print it.
//
# G here to the name of the food we ate
  meal="English Muffins"
  print("Breakfast:")
  print(meal)
# Now update meal to be lunch!
  meal="McDonalds"
# Printing out lunch
  print("Lunch:")
  print(meal)
#Print out dinner
  meal="Poteito Potato salad"
  print("Dinner:")
  print(meal)

6. Update the malformed strings in the workspace to all be strings.
//
Abracadabra = "This message has mismatched quote marks!"
print(Abracadabra)

7.1 Create the following variables and assign integer numbers to them: release_year and runtime.
//
release_year = 2022
runtime = 2023
7.2 Now, create the variable rating_out_of_10 and assign it a float number between one and ten.
//
rating_out_of_10=3.14

8. Print out the result of this equation: 25 * 68 + 13 / 28
//
print((25 * 68) + (13 / 28)

9.1 You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: quilt_width and quilt_length. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.
//
quilt_width=8
quilt_length=12
9.2 You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: quilt_width and quilt_length. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.
//
quilt_width=8
quilt_length=12
9.3 It turns out that quilt required a little more material than you have on hand! Let’s only make the quilt 8 squares long. How many squares will you need for this quilt instead?
//
quilt_length=8
print(quilt_width * quilt_length)

10.1 You really like how the square quilts from last exercise came out, and decide that all quilts that you make will be square from now on. 
Using the exponent operator, print out how many squares you’ll need for a 6x6 quilt, a 7x7 quilt, and an 8x8 quilt.
//
print(6 ** 2)
print(7 ** 2)
print(8 ** 2)
10.2 Your 6x6 quilts have become so popular that 6 people have each requested 6 quilts. Print out how many total tiles you would need to make 6 6x6 quilts for 6 people.
//
print(6 ** 4)
