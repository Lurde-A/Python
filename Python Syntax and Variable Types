1. Change Codecademy to your name in the script to the right. Run the code to see what it does!
//
my_name = "Lurdė"
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!");

2. Documentation is an important step in programming. Write a comment describing the first program you want to write!
//
# Lurde_A. First Python Program

3. Print the distinguished greeting “Hello world!”
//
print("Hello world!")

4. Print your name using the print() command.//
//
print("Lurde")           OR            print('Lurde')

5. Update the variable meal to reflect each meal of the day before we print it.
//
# G here to the name of the food we ate
  meal="English Muffins"
  print("Breakfast:")
  print(meal)
# Now update meal to be lunch!
  meal="McDonalds"
# Printing out lunch
  print("Lunch:")
  print(meal)
#Print out dinner
  meal="Poteito Potato salad"
  print("Dinner:")
  print(meal)

6. Update the malformed strings in the workspace to all be strings.
//
Abracadabra = "This message has mismatched quote marks!"
print(Abracadabra)

7.1 Create the following variables and assign integer numbers to them: release_year and runtime.
//
release_year = 2022
runtime = 2023
7.2 Now, create the variable rating_out_of_10 and assign it a float number between one and ten.
//
rating_out_of_10=3.14

8. Print out the result of this equation: 25 * 68 + 13 / 28
//
print((25 * 68) + (13 / 28)

9.1 You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: quilt_width and quilt_length. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.
//
quilt_width=8
quilt_length=12
9.2 You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: quilt_width and quilt_length. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.
//
quilt_width=8
quilt_length=12
9.3 It turns out that quilt required a little more material than you have on hand! Let’s only make the quilt 8 squares long. How many squares will you need for this quilt instead?
//
quilt_length=8
print(quilt_width * quilt_length)

10.1 You really like how the square quilts from last exercise came out, and decide that all quilts that you make will be square from now on. 
Using the exponent operator, print out how many squares you’ll need for a 6x6 quilt, a 7x7 quilt, and an 8x8 quilt.
//
print(6 ** 2)
print(7 ** 2)
print(8 ** 2)
10.2 Your 6x6 quilts have become so popular that 6 people have each requested 6 quilts. Print out how many total tiles you would need to make 6 6x6 quilts for 6 people.
//
print(6 ** 4)

11.1 To find the remainder of the division operation, you can use the modulo operator %. In this case, you would 
use 263 % 11 and store the result in the variable order_263_r.
//
order_263_r = 263 % 11
print (order_263_r)
11.2 Based on the value of order_263_r, should this order receive a coupon? Create a new variable called order_263_coupon and assign to it a value of "yes" 
if the order should get a coupon, otherwise "no".
//
order_263_coupon="No"
11.3 Here comes another order, #264! Find the remainder by calculating 264 modulo 11 and store the result in a variable called order_264_r.
Print out order_264_r.
//
order_264_r = 264 % 11
print (order_264_r)
11.4 Based on the value of order_264_r, should this order receive a coupon? Create a new variable called order_264_coupon 
and assign to it a value of "yes" if the order should get a coupon, otherwise "no".
//
order_264_coupon="Yes"

12. Concatenate the strings and save the message they form in the variable message.
Now uncomment the print statement and run your code to see the result in the terminal!
//
string1 = "The wind, "
string2 = "which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, "
string3 = "sank at sunset to a light breeze; "
string4 = "the soft air just ruffled the water and "
string5 = "caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, "
string6 = "from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay."

message=string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5 + string6
print(message)

13. We’re doing a little bit of online shopping and find a pair of new sneakers. Right before we check out, we spot a nice sweater and some fun books we also want to purchase!
Use the += operator to update the total_price to include the prices of nice_sweater and fun_books.
The prices (also included in the workspace) are:
- new_sneakers = 50.00
- nice_sweater = 39.00
- fun_books = 20.00
//
total_price = 0
new_sneakers = 50.00
total_price += new_sneakers

nice_sweater = 39.00
fun_books = 20.00

# Update total_price here:
total_price += nice_sweater
total_price += fun_books

print("The total price is", total_price)

14. Assign the string

Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why
  should you not speak to me?
And why should I not speak to you?

to the variable to_you.
//
to_you= """Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why
  should you not speak to me?
And why should I not speak to you?"""

print(to_you)

15. Create variables:
  my_age
  half_my_age
  greeting
  name
  greeting_with_name
Assign values to each using your knowledge of division and concatenation!
//
my_age = 29
half_my_age = my_age / 2
greeting = "How're you doing...?"
name = "Love"
greeting_with_name = greeting + name
