                                                      BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS
  1. Determine if the following statements are boolean expressions or not. If they are, set the matching variable to the right to "Yes" and if not set the variable to "No". 
Here’s an example of what to do:
Example statement:
"My dog is the cutest dog in the world."
This is an opinion and not a boolean expression, so you would set example_statement to "No" in the editor to the right. Okay, now it’s your turn:
//
- Statement one:
Dogs are mammals. 
- Statement two:
My dog is named Pavel.
- Statement three:
Dogs make the best pets.
- Statement four:
Cats are female dogs.

  2. Determine if the following boolean expressions are True or False. Input your answer as True or False in the appropriate variable to the right.
          Statement one:
          (5 * 2) - 1 == 8 + 1
          Statement two:
          13 - 6 != (3 * 2) + 1
          Statement three:
          3 * (2 - 1) == 4 - 1
//
statement_one = True
statement_two = False
statement_three = True

  3.1 Create a variable named my_baby_bool and set it equal to the string "true".
//
my_baby_bool = "true"
  3.2 Check the type of my_baby_bool using type(my_baby_bool). You’ll have to print it to get the results to display in the terminal.  
//
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))
  3.3 It’s not a boolean variable! Boolean values True and False always need to be capitalized and do not have quotation marks. Create a variable named my_baby_bool_two and set it equal to True.
//
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))
my_baby_bool_two = True
  3.4 Check the type of my_baby_bool_two and make sure you successfully created a boolean variable. You’ll have to print it to get the results to display in the terminal.
//
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))
my_baby_bool_two = True
print(type(my_baby_bool_two))
