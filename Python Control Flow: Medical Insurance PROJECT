  1. The function estimate_insurance_cost() estimates the medical insurance cost for an individual, based on four variables:

age: age of the individual in years
sex: 0 for female, 1 if male
num_of_children: number of children the individual has
smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
These variables are used in the following formula to estimate an individual’s insurance cost:

- age: age of the individual in years
- sex: 0 for female, 1 if male
- num_of_children: number of children the individual has
- smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker

insurance_cost=400∗age
−128∗sex+425∗num_of_children
+10000∗smoker−2500
//
# Add your code here
___
# Function to estimate insurance cost:
def estimate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost = 400*age - 128*sex + 425*num_of_children + 10000*smoker - 2500
  print(name + "'s Estimated Insurance Cost: " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
___
# Estimate Keanu's insurance cost
keanu_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = 'Keanu', age = 29, sex = 1, num_of_children = 3, smoker = 1)

OUTPUT:
"Keanu's Estimated Insurance Cost: 20247 dollars."

  2. It would be much more helpful if our function could provide more insight into how we can lower our insurance cost. We’ll learn to do exactly that by using control flow – if, 
elif, and else statements – in our code.
//
Here is a quick review on control flow if you need a reminder:
- if statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
- else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
- elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements.

ANALYZING SMOKER STATUS

  3. In general, insurance costs are higher for smokers. We can use data from the smoker variable to provide advice on how to lower insurance costs.
Let’s create a function that analyzes an individual’s smoking status.
At the top of your code, define a function called analyze_smoker() that takes an input smoker_status. For now, the function should print smoker_status.
//
def analyze_smoker(smoker_status):
  print(smoker_status)

  4. Inside of the analyze_smoker() function, replace the print statement you wrote in the previous step with an if/else statement that does the following:
If smoker_status is equal to 1, print "To lower your cost, you should consider quitting smoking."
Otherwise, print "Smoking is not an issue for you."
//
def analyze_smoker(smoker_status):
  if smoker_status==1:
    print("To lower your cost, you should consider quitting smoking.")
  else:
    print("Smoking is not an issue for you.")
...

  5. In the estimate_insurance_cost() function, go to the line of code that prints the estimated insurance cost. On the next line, make a function call to analyze_smoker(), 
passing in the smoker variable as an argument.
//
...
def estimate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost = 400*age - 128*sex + 425*num_of_children + 10000*smoker - 2500
  print(name + "'s Estimated Insurance Cost: " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
  analyze_smoker(smoker)
  return estimated_cost
...
OUTPUT:
"Keanu's Estimated Insurance Cost: 20247 dollars.
To lower your cost, you should consider quitting smoking."

  6. At the bottom of your code, create a new insurance cost variable for yourself, similar to how we did it for Keanu.
Set the variable equal to a function call to estimate_insurance_cost(), passing in your own age, sex, number of children, and smoker status.
//
...
lurde_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = 'Lurde', age = 29, sex = 0, num_of_children = 0, smoker = 0)
OUTPUT:
"Lurde's Estimated Insurance Cost: 9100 dollars.
Smoking is not an issue for you."
