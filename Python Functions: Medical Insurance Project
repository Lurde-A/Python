              1. First, take a look at the code in script.py.
In this code, we estimate the medical insurance costs for two individuals, Maria and Omar, based on five variables:
      age: age of the individual in years
      sex: 0 for female, 1 for male
      bmi: individual’s body mass index
      num_of_children: number of children the individual has
      smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
These variables are used in the following formula to estimate an individual’s insurance cost (in USD):
insurance_cost=250*age−128*sex+370*bmi+425*num_of_children+24000*smoker−12500
insurance_cost=250*age−128*sex
+370*bmi+425*num_of_children
+24000*smoker−12500
​//
# Initial variables for Maria 
age = 28
sex = 0  
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0  

# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
insurance_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500

print("The estimated insurance cost for Maria is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Initial variables for Omar
age = 35
sex = 1 
bmi = 22.2
num_of_children = 0
smoker = 1  

# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
insurance_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500

print("The estimated insurance cost for Omar is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


              2. The code used to estimate insurance costs for Maria and Omar looks quite similar – in both cases we calculate the insurance cost using the same formula and then print the output.
This code is a great candidate for a function because it involves repeating almost identical commands in multiple places.
Let’s start by defining a function called calculate_insurance_cost() on line 2. For now, your function should not have any parameters or output.
//

def calculate_insurance_cost():

# Initial variables for Maria 
age = 28
sex = 0  
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0  

# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
insurance_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500

print("The estimated insurance cost for Maria is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Initial variables for Omar
age = 35
sex = 1 
bmi = 22.2
num_of_children = 0
smoker = 1  

# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
insurance_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500

print("The estimated insurance cost for Omar is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

              3. Let’s outline the behavior we want our function to have. Inside of calculate_insurance_cost(), do the following:
      -  Create a variable called estimated_cost. For now, set this variable equal to a value of 1000. You’ll add the full formula in the next step.
      -  Add a print statement that prints estimated_cost. You should output a message similar to: "The estimated insurance cost for this person is xxx dollars."
      -  Return estimated_cost
//
def calculate_insurance_cost():
  estimated_cost=1000
  print("The estimated insurance cost for this person is" + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
...

              4. Modify the function definition so that it contains five parameters:
      - age
      - sex
      - bmi
      - num_of_children
      - smoker
Take a look at the hint if you need a reminder on how to add parameters to a function definition.
//
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children):
  estimated_cost=1000
  print("The estimated insurance cost for this person is" + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost

              5. In calculate_insurance_cost(), change the value of estimated_cost from 1000 to our formula for insurance cost.
Remember that the formula for insurance cost is:
250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
//
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print("The estimated insurance cost for this person is" + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
...

              6. The function is now properly set up to calculate an individual’s medical insurance costs based on the five variables passed into it. Let’s test this out!
Go to the section of code that estimates Maria’s insurance cost.
Rename insurance_cost as maria_insurance_cost and set it equal to calculate_insurance_cost() with the appropriate values for Maria as arguments.
//
...
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0)
...

              7. Now, remove the print statement for Maria since our function will take care of printing the estimated cost for us.
Additionally, remove the five lines of code defining the initial variables for Maria, as we are now passing in these values directly in the function call.
// 
WHAT'S LEFT IN A CODE:

# Create calculate_insurance_cost() function below: 
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print("The estimated insurance cost for this person is " + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost

# Initial variables for Maria 

# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0)

# Initial variables for Omar
age = 35
sex = 1 
bmi = 22.2
num_of_children = 0
smoker = 1  

# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
insurance_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500

print("The estimated insurance cost for Omar is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

              8. Repeat steps 6-7 for Omar:
Rename insurance_cost as omar_insurance_cost and set it equal to the calculate_insurance_cost() function, passing in the appropriate values as arguments.
Remove the initial variables and print statement for Omar.
Notice how much cleaner our code is now! By utilizing a Python function, we were able to condense many lines of code into just a few.
//
ef calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print("The estimated insurance cost for this person is " + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost

# Initial variables for Maria 
# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0)

# Initial variables for Omar
# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
omar_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=35, sex=1, bmi=21.2, num_of_children=0, smoker=1)

              9. In the output terminal, notice that it says "The estimated insurance cost for this person is..." but it does not specify the actual name of the person.
To fix this, begin by adding an additional parameter called name to the function definition.
//
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):
...

              10. Next, modify the print statement in the function so that it includes the new name parameter, replacing "this person" with the actual name of the person.
//
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print("The estimated insurance cost for" + name + "is " + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost

              11. We must also update our function calls, passing in the name variable as an argument.
Update the function call for maria_insurance_cost, passing in name = "Maria" as an argument.
Do the same for Omar, passing in name = "Omar".
Now if you click “Save”, you’ll see that our function is able to write a more personalized message specifying the name of the individual it is estimating insurance costs for. Pretty neat, right?
//
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print("The estimated insurance cost for" + name + "is " + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost

# Initial variables for Maria 
# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0, name=" Maria ")

# Initial variables for Omar
# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
omar_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=35, sex=1, bmi=21.2, num_of_children=0, smoker=1, name=" Omar ")

              12. At the bottom of your code, create a new insurance_cost variable for yourself, similar to how we did it for Maria and Omar.
Set the variable equal to a function call to calculate_insurance_cost(), passing in your own name, age, sex, bmi, number of children, and smoker status.
Click “Save” to see the result.
//
...
Lurde_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=**, sex=0, bmi=**.*, num_of_children=*, smoker=0, name=" Lurde ")

              13. Now it’s your turn! If you’d like extra practice with Python functions, here are some suggestions to get you started:
1) Modify the calculate_insurance_cost() function so that it returns two values – the output message and the estimated cost.
2) Create a second function to calculate the difference between the insurance costs (given as inputs) of any two individuals and print a statement saying: "The difference in insurance cost is xxx dollars."
//
1)# Create calculate_insurance_cost() function below: 
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):
  estimated_cost=250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  output_message=print("The estimated insurance cost for" + name + "is " + str(estimated_cost) + "dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
  return output_message
# Initial variables for Maria 
# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0, name=" Maria ")
# Initial variables for Omar
# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
omar_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=35, sex=1, bmi=21.2, num_of_children=0, smoker=1, name=" Omar ")
Lurde_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age=29, sex=0, bmi=20.7, num_of_children=0, smoker=0, name=" Lurde ")

2)
