1. First, define a function, directions_to_timesSq(). Leave the body of the function empty for now.
//
def directions_to_timesSq():

2. Within the body of the function, use three print() statements to output the following directions and call out the function:
- Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station
- Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop
- Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop
//
def directions_to_timesSq():
  print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station")
  print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop")
  print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop")
directions_to_timesSq()

3.1 Write a print() statement that will output Checking the weather for you!
//
print("Checking the weather for you!")

3.2 Write a function called weather_check() that will print a message to our users that itâ€™s a great day to travel! The function should output:
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")

3.3 In our weather_check() function add a second print() statement under the first one which prints a warning message for our travelers! It should print:
"False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside."
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
  print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")

3.4 Call the function weather_check().
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
  print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")
weather_check()

3.5 Unindent your final print statement in your weather_check() function. Run the program again. What is different?
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")
weather_check()
