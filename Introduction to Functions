1. First, define a function, directions_to_timesSq(). Leave the body of the function empty for now.
//
def directions_to_timesSq():

2. Within the body of the function, use three print() statements to output the following directions and call out the function:
- Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station
- Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop
- Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop
//
def directions_to_timesSq():
  print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station")
  print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop")
  print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop")
directions_to_timesSq()

3.1 Write a print() statement that will output Checking the weather for you!
//
print("Checking the weather for you!")

3.2 Write a function called weather_check() that will print a message to our users that it’s a great day to travel! The function should output:
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")

3.3 In our weather_check() function add a second print() statement under the first one which prints a warning message for our travelers! It should print:
"False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside."
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
  print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")

3.4 Call the function weather_check().
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
  print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")
weather_check()

3.5 Unindent your final print statement in your weather_check() function. Run the program again. What is different?
//
def weather_check():
  print("Looks great outside! Enjoy your trip.")
print("False Alarm, the weather changed! There is a thunderstorm approaching. Cancel your plans and stay inside.")
weather_check()

4.1 Create a function called generate_trip_instructions() that defines one parameter called location.
//
def generate_trip_instructions(location):

4.2 generate_trip_instructions() should print out the following: "Looks like you are planning a trip to visit <location>"
Where <location> will represent the location parameter.
//
def generate_trip_instructions(location):
  print("Looks like you are planning a trip to visit " + location)

4.3 Let’s have generate_trip_instructions()also print out the following on a new line: "You can use the public subway system to get to <location>"
Where <location> will represent the location parameter.
//
def generate_trip_instructions(location):
  print("Looks like you are planning a trip to visit " + location)
  print("You can use the public subway system to get to " + location)

4.4 Time for some greenery! Let’s see what happens when we call the function and input the argument "Central Park", a backyard wonder in the heart of New York City.
//
def generate_trip_instructions(location):
  print("Looks like you are planning a trip to visit " + location)
  print("You can use the public subway system to get to " + location)
generate_trip_instructions("Central Park")

4.5 The day trip is over and we need to get back to the train station to head home. Change the argument to "Grand Central Station" and call the function again.
What changed in the output?
//
def generate_trip_instructions(location):
  print("Looks like you are planning a trip to visit " + location)
  print("You can use the public subway system to get to " + location)
generate_trip_instructions("Grand Central Station")
