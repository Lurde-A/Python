1. First, define a function, directions_to_timesSq(). Leave the body of the function empty for now.
//
def directions_to_timesSq():

2.Within the body of the function, use three print() statements to output the following directions and call out the function:
- Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station
- Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop
- Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop
//
def directions_to_timesSq():
  print("Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station")
  print("Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop")
  print("Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop")
directions_to_timesSq()
